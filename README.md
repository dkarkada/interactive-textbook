# An interactive textbook

Whenever I'm trying to read a textbook, I usually find that it's either quite repetitive on topics I already know, or flies way over my head with details that I don't care about (yet). It's difficult to find reading material that feels just right for my level. Trying to develop educational resources for high school students interested in astrophysics, I wanted to avoid this problem, especially since high school students can have pretty diverse levels of background knowledge.

That's why I developed this template for online textbooks that can accommodate writing at three levels of expertise. The level is toggle-able by the reader; a reader that wants advanced content can read the sections that dive deeper into the material, while the first-time reader can fold away content that isn't crucial to the initial conceptual understanding. I believe this pedagogical approach is FAR more effective for self-driven students.
